(define penguins? (hash/c penguin? (listof posn?)))
;; A GameState is a:
;; (make-state board? penguins? (listof player?) (listof player?) (non-empty-listof penguin?))
;; And represents a fish game state, containing:
;; - the current board state
;; - the current positions of penguins on the board
;; - the current players and their penguin color
;; - players removed from the game
;; - the order of the players' turns, denoted by their color
;; INVARIANT: the length of players and removed-players is the same the whole duration of the game
;; INVARIANT: state-order is an ordered list, with the first being the current
;;            players turn, second being the turn after the first, and so on...

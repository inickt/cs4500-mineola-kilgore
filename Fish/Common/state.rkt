;; A GameState is a:

;; - the current board state
;; - the current positions of penguins on the board
;; - the current players and their penguins
;; - the order of the players' turns, denoted by their color
;; INVARIANT: state-order is an ordered list, with the first being the current
;;            players turn, second being the turn after the first, and so on...

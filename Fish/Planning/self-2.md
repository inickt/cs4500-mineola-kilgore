## Self-Evaluation Form for Milestone 2

A fundamental guideline of Fundamentals I, II, and OOD is to design
methods and functions systematically, starting with a signature, a
clear purpose statement (possibly illustrated with examples), and
unit tests.

Under each of the following elements below, indicate below where your
TAs can find:

- the data description of tiles, including an interpretation:
https://github.ccs.neu.edu/CS4500-F20/mineola/blob/a27166fc4aa75109955095c99ddb8a2bf58a4231/Fish/Common/tile.rkt#L51-L53

- the data description of boards, include an interpretation:
https://github.ccs.neu.edu/CS4500-F20/mineola/blob/a27166fc4aa75109955095c99ddb8a2bf58a4231/Fish/Common/board.rkt#L28-L49

- the functionality for removing a tile:
  - purpose:
  https://github.ccs.neu.edu/CS4500-F20/mineola/blob/a27166fc4aa75109955095c99ddb8a2bf58a4231/Fish/Common/board.rkt#L96
  - signature:
  https://github.ccs.neu.edu/CS4500-F20/mineola/blob/a27166fc4aa75109955095c99ddb8a2bf58a4231/Fish/Common/board.rkt#L94
  - unit tests:
  https://github.ccs.neu.edu/CS4500-F20/mineola/blob/a27166fc4aa75109955095c99ddb8a2bf58a4231/Fish/Common/board.rkt#L282-L296

- the functiinality for reaching other tiles on the board:
  - purpose:
  https://github.ccs.neu.edu/CS4500-F20/mineola/blob/a27166fc4aa75109955095c99ddb8a2bf58a4231/Fish/Common/board.rkt#L103
  - signature:
  https://github.ccs.neu.edu/CS4500-F20/mineola/blob/a27166fc4aa75109955095c99ddb8a2bf58a4231/Fish/Common/board.rkt#L102
  - unit tests:
  https://github.ccs.neu.edu/CS4500-F20/mineola/blob/a27166fc4aa75109955095c99ddb8a2bf58a4231/Fish/Common/board.rkt#L297-L319

The ideal feedback is a GitHub perma-link to the range of lines in specific
file or a collection of files for each of the above bullet points.

  WARNING: all such links must point to your commit "24c421240b9606e142b11b292a86f2ab7652e8ea".
  Any bad links will result in a zero score for this self-evaluation.
  Here is an example link:
    <https://github.ccs.neu.edu/CS4500-F20/mineola/tree/24c421240b9606e142b11b292a86f2ab7652e8ea/Fish>

A lesser alternative is to specify paths to files and, if files are
longer than a laptop screen, positions within files are appropriate
responses.

In either case you may wish to, beneath each snippet of code you
indicate, add a line or two of commentary that explains how you think
the specified code snippets answers the request.
